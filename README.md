# Blinkit-SQL-Analysis
SQL project analyzing Blinkit sales data using 9,000+ rows, performing data cleaning, transformations, and generating insights.

### Blinkit Sales Analysis Using SQL

 **Problem Statement**
Businesses often collect large volumes of data but struggle to derive actionable insights.  
The goal of this project was to use **SQL** to:
- Organize and clean raw data  
- Write optimized queries  
- Perform analysis  
- Generate reports that support better decision-making  

### Blinkit  Analysis
**See all the data imported**
     
> `  SELECT * FROM blinkit_data`

**DATA CLEANING **
Cleaning the `Item Fat Content` field ensures data consistency and accuracy in analysis. The presence of multiple variations of the same category (e.g., LF, low fat vs. Low Fat) can cause issues in reporting, aggregations, and filtering. By standardizing these values, we improve data quality, making it easier to generate insights and maintain uniformity in our datasets.
 ```

UPDATE blinkit_data
SET Item_Fat_Content = 
    CASE 
        WHEN Item_Fat_Content IN ('LF', 'low fat') THEN 'Low Fat'
        WHEN Item_Fat_Content = 'reg' THEN 'Regular'
        ELSE Item_Fat_Content
    END;
```

- After executing this query check the data has been cleaned or not using below query

> SELECT DISTINCT `Item Fat Content` FROM blinkit_data;

FROM blinkit_data;
 
```

**B. Total Sales by Fat Content:**
```
SELECT Item_Fat_Content, CAST(SUM(Total_Sales) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS Total_Sales
FROM blinkit_data
GROUP BY Item_Fat_Content
```
 

**C. Total Sales by Item Type**
```
SELECT Item_Type, CAST(SUM(Total_Sales) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS Total_Sales
FROM blinkit_data
GROUP BY Item_Type

       ISNULL([Regular], 0) AS Regular
FROM 
(
    SELECT Outlet_Location_Type, Item_Fat_Content, 
           CAST(SUM(Total_Sales) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS Total_Sales
    FROM blinkit_data
    GROUP BY Outlet_Location_Type, Item_Fat_Content
) AS SourceTable

    FOR Item_Fat_Content IN ([Low Fat], [Regular])
) AS PivotTable
ORDER BY Outlet_Location_Type;

```

```
SELECT Outlet_Establishment_Year, CAST(SUM(Total_Sales) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS Total_Sales
FROM blinkit_data
GROUP BY Outlet_Establishment_Year

```

**F. Percentage of Sales by Outlet Size**

```
SELECT 
    Outlet_Size, 
    CAST(SUM(Total_Sales) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS Total_Sales,
